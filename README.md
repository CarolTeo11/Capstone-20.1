## Project Title:  Predicting Depression in Rural Areas

- by CT


### Executive summary

This project uses routine survey data from Kenya to predict depression.  In rural areas where psychiatric help is limited, it is important to be able to accurate predict the 

#### Background

A few years back, the World Health Organization estimated that 1.3 million Kenyans suffer from untreated major depressive disorder (MDD; commonly known as depression) every year, and that sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of the illness of any region in the world. Yet mental health treatment in Kenya suffers from a lack of resources and stigmatization. There are only two certified psychiatrists per million people in Kenya. Few facilities exist outside of urban areas and people are unlikely to know about or access them.

With this in mind, the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics has decided to challenge the data science community in Nairobi, across Africa, and around the world to predict depression cases from routine survey data.

Even though this challenge was done a while ago, the data remains relevant for data scientists to predict depression so that valuable resources can be targeted at more vulnerable persons to help assess their mental health conditions and if needed, help them seek treatment as soon as possible.  


### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

Depression, if left untreated, can become an issue for the individual and their family members.  The issue can be exercerbated if the person is the sole breadwinner of the family.  However, in a country faced with poverty and limited medical resources, there is a need to prioritise such resources. 

Hence, in this assessment, i hope to be able to predict true positive with high accuracy while minimising false positive so that we strike a balance between good predictions and resource allocation.   


### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

Classify, with high accuracy, the personnels with depression.  
Measures of Effectiveness:  Minimize False Negative ==> Metrics: Maximise Recall = True Positive/ (True Positive + False Negative) 
Minimize False Postive (to minimise unnecessary resources allocated) ==> Metrics: Maximize Precision = True Positive/ (True Positive + False Positive)
